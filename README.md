The film industry is gradually decreasing after the pandemic since people began to consume video content at home via OTT platforms.
I was curious about 'when was the most flourishing year of the movie industry' among the top 200 movies that recorded the grossest profit.
Therefore, the goal of this project is to find the year in the film industry that made the most return.

I did not use any API for this project. 

My data is from the website https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/ww_top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW. 
The website is operated by IMDbPro.

Rank: Numerical data; the ranking of each movie based on Worldwide Lifetime Gross <br />
Title: Categorical data; the title of the movie <br />
Worldwide Lifetime Gross: Numerical data; the amount of money the movie has made worldwide; the unit is $ <br />
Domestic Lifetime Gross: Numerical data; the amount of money the movie has made only in the US; the unit is $ <br />
Domestic %: Numerical data; the percentage of domestic lifetime gross out of worldwide lifetime gross <br />
Foreign Lifetime Gross: Numerical data; the amount of money the movie has made outside the US; the unit is $ <br />
Foreign %: Numerical data; the percentage of foreign lifetime gross out of worldwide lifetime gross <br />
Year: Numerical data; the year when each movie was released 

This data frame only provides the gross of 200 movies that are the most successful in film history. Therefore, we have to be cautious about generalization. As you can see visualized data of my data frame, among the 200 most successful films, the number of films released in 2017 is the highest. On the other hand, there are only three movies in 1997. This does not mean 1997 was one of the most failed years of the film industry because those three movies are "Titanic," "The Lost World: Jurassic Park," and "Men in Black." Everyone knows those three movies are remarkable, legendary, and historic. Accordingly, it is wrong to look at this histogram and say that the year with fewer movies is the year of failure since the number of movies released and people's surroundings are different and changing every year.
